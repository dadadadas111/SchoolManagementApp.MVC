# School Management App (MVC) Documentation

---

## Project Introduction

The **School Management App (MVC)** is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the administrative and academic processes of schools. The application provides a centralized platform for managing student records, class schedules, attendance, grades, and communication between parents, teachers, and administrators. Built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the app ensures scalability, maintainability, and a clean separation of concerns.

This project is targeted at small to medium-scale educational institutions, with the ability to handle up to 500 students. The system is designed to be lightweight and efficient, focusing on core functionalities with room for future enhancements.

## Project Plan

The development of the School Management App is divided into the following phases:

| **Phase**               | **Duration** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirement Analysis    | 1 week       | Gather functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.           |
| System Design           | 1 week       | Design the database schema and application architecture.                       |
| Development             | 2 weeks      | Implement core modules, including student and class management.                |
| Testing                 | 1 week       | Conduct testing to ensure functionality.                  |
